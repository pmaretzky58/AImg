    <ul>
		<dd style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Creating images with AI is like teaching a digital artist and a critic to work together. The artist tries to draw pictures, and the critic decides if they look real or not. At first, the artist's drawings might not be great, but with feedback from the critic, the artist improves over time. After they've practiced enough, the artist can draw pictures that look very real. This process needs powerful computer tools, but thanks to special websites, anyone can use it without needing to know all the technical details.<dd>
	   <dt><strong>1. Understanding the Basics:</strong></dt>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">while generating AI images can be computationally intensive, the proliferation of cloud platforms and dedicated AI generation websites has made the process more accessible to a broader audience. Whether you're a hobbyist, artist, or researcher, there are tools and platforms available to help you bring your creative vision to life.</li>
		
		<dt><strong>2. Computing Power:</strong></dt>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Generating AI images on your local computer requires a lot of power. You will need a graphics card that has 6gb of video memory or more. You will also need a minimum of 16gb of memory.</li>    
		
		<dt><strong>3. Using Cloud Platforms & Hosted Solutions:</strong></dt>
        <li>Fortunately, there are iPhone and Android applications as well as cloud platforms. Additionally, platforms like Google Colab provide free access to GPUs for a limited time, which is great for experimentation.There are also websites and platforms dedicated to AI image generation. Platforms like DeepArt, DeepDream, and RunwayML allow users to generate AI images without any coding or setting up infrastructure.</li>
