	<h2>Generative Fill,</h2>
		<dd style="margin-bottom: 20px;"> The most popular use of AI imaging is within Photoshop. This year (2023), Adobe released their version called "Generative Fill" Generative fill uses AI imaging and allows it to study your picture and fill in a selection based on the prompt you give it, or you can leave it blank and let Photoshop decide what to fill. This feature is amazing for removing items from a photo in seconds. You no longer have to manually fill in and paint away an object. Instead, just make a selection and press generate. It's that simple!<dd>

	<h2>OpenAI, MidJourney, and Stable Diffusion,</h2>
		<dd style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Additionally, you can generate whole images and finetune them to your liking. you can add a promt. a negative promt to tell the generator waht not to do, and you can even leave the prompt blank for completely random results. OpenAI is an early founder of AI generated imaging. They host their own program that is avalible to use. You can generate images with dalle here, <a href="https://openai.com/dall-e-2">Visit DALL·E 2 on OpenAI</a>.</dd>
	<dd style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Midjourney and stable diffusion are other companies that have used their own set of data to train their own image generators. they are pretty close in quality but recently stable diffusion has taken the lead in terms of detail. Running stable diffusion requires coding and knowladge of your computers file systems. It is a thurough process that has been broken down for easy install.
